"Well done Hunter!\nNow that we have access to the makeshift camp we can finally see if the old radio station is still active.\nWe don't know the coordinates but I think it will be easy to find it on the map, it should be a paved area.\nAll I ask you to do is go there and see what the situation is like and report back, if you encounter any strange anomalies or mutants there is no need to engage in a fight.","Quest descriptions","1024","Well done Hunter!\nNow that we have access to the makeshift camp we can finally see if the old radio station is still active.\nWe don't know the coordinates but I think it will be easy to find it on the map, it should be a paved area.\nAll I ask you to do is go there and see what the situation is like and report back, if you encounter any strange anomalies or mutants there is no need to engage in a fight."
"From the helicopter's black box we were able to discover that the crew had spotted a strange purple crystal in the swamp.\nShortly thereafter, there appears to have been an unusual burst of radiation.\nThe crystal appears to be in the swamp village… There are good and bad news Hunter... The bad news is that there is a large amount of Ghouls in the village in the swamp, and I don't think you will make it alone.\nThe good one is that I contacted the Green Army, they are interested in cleaning up the village to get to the crystal.\nHere's the plan, Hunter.\nEntering the village with all those Ghouls would be a certain death sentence.\nThe village has only one entrance so you will try to lure them out with a very bright light, it will have to be done at night.\nGet into the swamp from 10pm to 3am, Green Army soldiers will be waiting for you.\nIt is advisable to bring an automatic weapon or a shotgun with a large magazine so that you have to reload as little as possible.
